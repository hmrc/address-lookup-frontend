# Address Lookup Frontend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/address-lookup-frontend.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/address-lookup-frontend-new) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/address-lookup-frontend/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/address-lookup-frontend/_latestVersion)

This microservice provides a user interface for entering and editing addresses. Assistance is provided to the end-user for looking up their address from a database (via the backend service [address-lookup](https://github.com/hmrc/address-lookup)).

Initially, the use-case covers only UK addresses. BFPO addresses might be added soon. The roadmap includes support for international addresses.

## Functional Overview

### Address Lookup Frontend has been updated, for version 1 of the API, see [the old README](DEPRECATED.md).
The API has been updated to split out the configuration from the custom labels, and to allow Welsh content labels to be provided. The old API is still supported under the original endpoints.

### Summary

During the utilization of `address-lookup-frontend`, four parties are involved:

* A frontend service in the tax platform (the **"calling service"** here).
* The user-agent (i.e. web browser) and the user who operates it (the **"user"** here).
* The `address-lookup-frontend` (the **"frontend"** here).
* The backend `address-lookup`, containing large national datasets of addresses (the **"backend"** here).

The integration process from the perspective of the **calling service** consists of the following steps:

* _Initialize_ a **journey** by issuing a request to `POST /api/v2/init` where the message body is a **journey configuration** JSON message (see below). You should receive a `202 Accepted` response with a `Location` header the value of which is the **"on ramp"** URL to which the **"user"** should be redirected.
* _Redirect_ the **"user"** to the **"on ramp"** URL.
* The **"user"** completes the journey, following which they will be redirected to the **"off ramp"** URL (which is configured as part of the journey) with an appended `id=:addressId` URL parameter.
* Using the value of the `id` parameter, you can retrieve the user's confirmed address as JSON by issuing a request to `GET /api/confirmed?id=:addressId`. 

### Initializing a Journey

The first action by any **calling service** must be to **"initialize"** an address lookup **journey** in order to obtain an "on ramp" URL to which the **"user"** is then redirected. 

Initialization generates an ID which is utilized both to facilitate subsequent retrieval of the **"user's"** confirmed address *and* to prevent arbitrary access to and potential abuse of `address-lookup-frontend` by malicious **"users"**.

An endpoint is provided for initialization:

URL:

* `/api/v2/init`

Methods:

* `POST`

Message Body:

* A **journey configuration** message in `application/json` format (see details of the JSON format below)

Status Codes:

* 202 Accepted: when initialization was successful
* 500 Internal Server Error: when, for any (hopefully transient) internal reason, the journey could not be initialized 

Response:

* No content
* The `Location` header will specify an **"on ramp"** URL, appropriate for the journey, to which the user should be redirected. Currently, the journey has a TTL of **60 minutes**.

### Configuring a Journey

The `address-lookup-frontend` allows the **"calling service"** to customize many aspects of the **"user's"** journey and the appearance of the **"frontend"** user interface. Journey configuration is supplied as a JSON object in the body of the request to `POST /api/v2/init` (see above).

It is **not** necessary to specify values for all configurable properties. _Only supply a value for properties where it is either required or you need to override the default_. Wherever possible, sensible defaults have been provided. The default values are indicated in the table detailing the options below.

#### Configuration JSON Format

Journey configuration is supplied as a JSON object in the body of the request to `POST /api/v2/init`.

It is **not** necessary to specify values for all configurable properties. _Only supply a value for properties where it is either required or you need to override the default_. Wherever possible, sensible defaults have been provided. The default values are indicated in the table detailing the options below.

A "cy" object is required within the labels section to enable the Welsh journey, even if no custom content is provided. This is to allow calling services to specify whether Welsh should be available. Welsh content is displayed for users when the "cy" object has been included and the PLAY_LANG cookie is set to "cy". A link to enable users to change their language will be displayed when the Welsh journey is enabled.

Additional configuration options may be introduced in future; for instance to prohibit "edit", to bypass "lookup", or to modify validation procedures for international or BFPO addresses. However, the design intent is that **all** configuration options should **always** have a default value. Consequently, **"calling services"** should only ever need to provide overrides to specific keys, rather than re-configuring or duplicating the entire journey for each scenario.

#### ukMode (Optional)

When enabled:

Lookup returns Only UK Addresses; 1 link on Lookup Page is overridden; Edit Address Mode removes option to change country (Defaults to United Kingdom) and omits postcode field.

### Obtaining the Confirmed Address

Once the user has completed the address lookup journey, they will be redirected to the **off ramp** URL specified in the **journey configuration**. An `id` parameter will be appended to the **off ramp** URL. **Calling services** may use the value of this parameter to obtain the **user's** confirmed address.

URL:

* `/api/confirmed`

Example URLs:

* `/api/confirmed?id=ID_VALUE_FROM_APPENDED_OFF_RAMP_URL_ID_PARAMETER_HERE`

Methods:

* `GET`

Message Body:

* None

Status Codes:

* 200 Ok: when a confirmed address was successfully obtained for the given `ID`
* 404 Not Found: when no confirmed address was found for the given `ID`
* 500 Internal Server Error: when, for any (hopefully transient) internal reason, the journey data corresponding to the ID could not be obtained 

Response:

* An `application/json` message which describes a **confirmed address** (see below)

#### Confirmed Address example JSON Format

```json
{
    "auditRef" : "bed4bd24-72da-42a7-9338-f43431b7ed72",
    "id" : "GB990091234524",
    "address" : {
        "lines" : [ "10 Other Place", "Some District", "Anytown" ],
        "postcode" : "ZZ1 1ZZ",
        "country" : {
            "code" : "GB",
            "name" : "United Kingdom"
        }
    }
}
```

### Running the Application

sm --start ADDRESS_LOOKUP_SERVICES -f
sm --stop ADDRESS_LOOKUP_FRONTEND

run with
sbt "run 9028 -Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes" (when in the address-lookup-frontend folder)

go to localhost:9028/lookup-address/test-only/v2/test-setup if not running from another service
